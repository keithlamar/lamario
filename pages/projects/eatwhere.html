<p>This is an app I created in a Front-End Development course I took through <a>ThinkFul</a>. Below were the requirements for the app.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You'll be creating a web app that interfaces with a third-party API and does something interesting with the data. We'll leave it up to you to decide which API you want to use and what you want to do with the data, but do make sure to consult your mentor before you start coding up your project to ensure you wonâ€™t run into unexpected API rate limits or technology requirements. When you have an idea you want to pursue, post it in your Google+ community to get feedback and suggestions from your fellow students.</li>

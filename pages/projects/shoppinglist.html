<h1>Shopping List</h1>
<a href="http://keithlamar.github.io/shoppinglist/" target="_blank" class="button [radius round]">View Project</a>
<p>This is an app I created in a Front-End Development course I took through <a>ThinkFul</a>. Below were the requirements for the app.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Users should be able to add and check off items from their shopping list.</li>
	<li>There should be distinct styles for added and checked off items so user can easily distinguish.</li>
	<li>The app should use an HTML form to get user inputs. If you donâ€™t yet know how to do form handling, check out this JavaScript Introduction to Forms</li>
	<li>The app should check for and notify users about invalid inputs (for instance, blanks or spaces only).</li>
	
</ul>

<h1>Quiz App</h1>
<a href="http://keithlamar.github.io/videogamequiz/" target="_blank" class="button [radius round]">View Project</a>
<p>This is an app I created in a Front-End Development course I took through <a>ThinkFul</a>. Below were the requirements for the app.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Lead the user through a set of questions. The user should only see one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered the current one. You should use jQuery to move between questions as the user enters their response</li>
	<li>Allow the user to input his or her response to each questions with radio buttons for the user to enter their response</li>
	<li>When the user answers the last question, the quiz should show his or her overall score</li>
	<li>Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll want to store your list of questions in an array. For example: var questions = [{question: "What is the capital of the US", choices: ["Washington DC", "NYC", "Silicon Valley"], correct:0}];</li>
	<li>Let the user know where in the quiz they are at each step (i.e. “Question 3 of 5)</li>
	<li>Let the user know if their previous response was correct </li>
	

</ul>
